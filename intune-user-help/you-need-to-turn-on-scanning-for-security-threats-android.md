# Enable security threat scans on your device

App help to accomplish a wide variety of tasks, but if you unknowingly install an unsafe app, you may encounter problems on your device. To protect the data on your device:
* Only download apps from verified sources, such as the Google Play Store. 
* Enable security threat scans on your device. These scans are performed by Google and verify that apps are safe to install.

To enable the scans on your device go to **Settings** > **Google** > **Security**. Turn on **Scan device for security threats**.

On some Samsung devices, you may find the scan setting in **Settings > Google > Security > Google Play Protect**.
